/**
 * This interface, named after the in-universe headset, contains all the methods necessary to make
 * the tool work. Implementations can be for any edition of Cyberpunk, but care must be taken to
 * code methods in a way that would make sense within that system. A Cyberpunk Red module will have
 * a wildly different way to track Netrunners than a Cyberpunk 2020 module. However, it is up to
 * the user to choose implementation, so it is possible to mix different aspects of Cyberpunk
 * editions.
